ARNAQ creates a number of R objects in the course of a run, which remain available after the run is
completed. The rationale for this is twofold. Firstly, some of this data (count tables read from 
files, for example) is useful for any downstream analysis and it is useful to already have this
available in an R session. Secondly, the user can alter the appearance of the final report by 
altering plots and/or changing which sections are included. The default versions will probably be
suitable in most instances, but it is impractical to anticipate every change a user might need to 
make to the final appearance of the plot or report and this method provides an accessible method 
of customisation without overencumbering the main functions with options.

All of these objects will be overwritten by a subsequent ARNAQ run in the same session. As the 
intention is for sequential runs for the same project to be iterations towards a final version of
the report, this should not be a problem. If necessary, the R session object can be copied into a 
different directory or the objects renamed 

These objects can broken down into three categories:

# Report Preparation

These objects are used internally by ARNAQ when preparing a report, but also need to be supplied
when recreating a report after fine-tuning plots. `arnaq.create.report()` uses default values 
for some of its parameters that match these object names.

## all_plots

This named list contains all the plot objects that are used in the report. Full details are 
provided in a [separate vignette](all-plots.html).

## arnaq.plot.flags

A named list of logical values that controls which sections and plots are included when  
`arnaq.create.report()` is used. This object is created with values that reflect what data
was available for the run. Specific plots can be set to `FALSE` to exclude them anyway. Changing a
value to `TRUE` is not recommended as it is unlikely that the underlying plot the report would need
is available.

## arnaq.report.template

This is the file path to the ARNAQ report template, as given in `resources.yml`.

## arnaq.run

A list containing supplementary data about the ARNAQ run, covered later.

## qc.name

The extended name for this ARNAQ run, based on the project id given in `resources.yml` and the 
`model.name` paramter (if any) given to `arnaq()`.

# Important Data

These are the primary pieces of data associated with the project; those most likely to be useful in
downstream analysis or to be inspected within R.

## count.data

The complete raw counts table, as read in from the data file and without any filtering.

## gene.masks

This is a list of logical masks for genes, rather than samples. Most categories are pulled from the
`genome_reference` file specified in `resources.yml`.

- `Genes` denotes identifiers listed as genes.
- `ERCC` are for ERCC spike-ins. Any gene identifier that starts with ERCC will be considered as 
such, if ERCC functionality is turned on in `arnaq()`.
- `protein_coding`, `miRNA`, `lncRNA`, `sRNA`, `snoRNA`, `snRNA` and `scaRNA`, as defined in the 
.gtf file, are present. tRNA is listed as 'sRNA' in the Ensembl data file.
- `ncRNA` represents the union of the previous set of categories.

For all masks except ERCC, the main masks excludes genes with no reads for any sample. If you want
an equivalent mask that includes these zero read genes, append `_Z` to the name.

The ERCC mask is not filtered in this way, on the basis that missing spike-ins are anticipated to 
be of interest when checking observed against expected reads.

## norm.data

The normalised count data. This is filtered by both `sample.mask` and `gene.masks$Genes`. The
type of normalisation performed in set as a paramter in `arnaq()`. In the special case where
no normalisation is performed, this will be the filtered raw count matrix.

## sample.mask

The sample mask supplied to `arnaq()` is stored here. The `count.data` and `sample.metadata`
entries below are **not** filtered by this mask.

## sample.metadata

The complete sample metadata table, as read in from the data file and without any filtering. You 
can use the group columns of this object to create sample masks for use with `arnaq()`, 
instead of or in combination with `make_outlier_mask()`.

## species.gtf

The Ensembl .gtf file used to find gene categories is stored in the session.

# Other Data and Metadata

Other data is placed in the `arnaq.run` list object under the following names, to avoid cluttering 
up the main session. This includes complete R copies of some of the source files for the ARNAQ run.

These entries are separated by category here for convenience.

## Run Information

Information about the run itself.

### version

The version of ARNAQ used.

### date

The date the run was started.

### resources

The file path of `resources.yml`.

### biotype.conversion.table

The table used to map the full set of Ensembl biotypes to more readable consolidated categories.

### project.id

The project name given in `resources.yml`. Used in combination with the `model.name` parameter of
`arnaq()` to give the full name of a run.

### genome.file

The .gtf file used to determine gene biotype, if any was provided.

### out.directory

The directory the output files appeared in. Currently `./QC/`.

### model.formula

The model formula, based on the treatment groups specified, as used by DESeq2 for normalisation.

## Input Data

Other data as read from external files.

### read.summary

The table of mapped reads assigned to categories, as per featureCounts or equivalent, as in the
`summary_table` entry of `resources.yml`, if available.

### count.metrics

The table of metrics for samples, as calculated by Picard or equivalent, as in the `metrics_table`
and `duplication_table` of `resources.yml`, if availble.

### ERCC.data

The table of counts of ERCC spike-ins per samples, if the `ERCC` paramter is `TRUE` in the 
`arnaq()` run.

## Derived Data

Data that is calculated from the sets loaded in.

### complexity.matrix

The complexity matrix is a long format dataframe based on sample and top N genes, with a value of 
the proportion of the sample reads contained within that top N.

### cpm.matrix

The cpm matrix as calculated based on the normalised read counts.

### norm.PCA

The Principle Components Analysis based on the normalised read counts. This is a list with
three members. `PC` is the matrix itself. `Vars` is the vector giving the propotions of variability
explained by each component. `CumulVars` is the cumulative version of the previous.

### ERCC.data.cpm

The cpm version of `ERCC.data`.

### biotype.counts

Table of reads collated into the Ensembl biotype categories, in the simplified mapping provided by
the support file `biotype_conversion` in `resources.yml`.
