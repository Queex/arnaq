# Assignment Summary

Reads may not be assigned to features for one of a number of reasons. Exact categories depend on
the input data, but common categories are:

- **Ambiguity**: The read maps, but overlaps multiple features.
- **MultiMapping**: The read maps to multiple locations in the transcriptome so
cannot be assigned uniquely. Note that such reads are double-counted (or more)
so a large number may exaggerate the total number of reads.
- **NoFeatures**: The read maps, but does not overlap any defined features.
- **Unmapped**: The read does not map well.

Additionally, If ERCC spike-ins are present, they are considered separately from
the requested feature set (which are typically Ensembl genes).

# Library Complexity

Poor-quality samples often have a smaller number of genes represented than the rest,
or a disproportionately large number of reads mapping to only a subset of genes.

## Diversity of Reads
These curves show how many of the total reads map to the most-expressed genes
for each sample. Samples that start at a high value, or follow a markedly different
curve to the rest, are likely to be unreliable.

# Ensembl Biotype Breakdown
Ensembl provides a mapping of genes to [biotypes](https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html).
This can be used to determine if any unwanted categories are over-represented 
in the samples. Biotypes have been collapsed into a smaller number of 
categories here to aid clarity.

# Normalisation Performance
For the following plots, the gene counts are normalised using a
variance-stabilising technique^[The details can be found in the [DESeq2 documentation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html ).] In some projects, with poor-quality data, the
normalisation is less effective than is ideal. The ideal result is for the
red trend line to be close to horizontal. For projects where it is not, the 
rest of the QC may not be reliable.

Each cell is coloured depending on how many genes fall within it.

# Hierarchical Clustering {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Inter-sample similarity can be used to confirm that different experimental
groups for clusters in the data. It can also reveal unexpected features, such
as batch effects, that may need to be adjusted for in downstream analysis.

Two methods of measuring this similarity are given here: Euclidean distance and
Spearman's Rank correlation. The former is more sensitive to outlier samples
but typically provides more detail as to clustering.

The heatmaps show sample-to-sample similarity scores. The dendrograms show how 
samples cluster in a binary tree.

# Principal Components Analysis

PCA aims to simplify the display of high dimensional data set in such a way as 
to make any clustering immediately apparent. The most significant components
are shown here as one of the axes in each plot. Often, only two components are
significant and hence only a single plot is required.

The amount of the total variation accounted for by each component is shown.

Ideally each experimental group will be its own cluster, on at least one of
these plots.

# Additional Metrics {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Additional metrics for the dataset, provided by Picard, are plotted here. What
constitutes a 'good' metric will vary depending on the tissue used and the
sequencing protocol. Large disparities between experimental might indicate
data quality issues.

Picard is a popular tool for generating these metrics, using [RnaSeqMetrics](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html ) 
and [MarkDuplicates](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard).

- All: The number of bases in total.
- Aligned: The number of bases aligned.
- Coding: The number of bases aligned to coding regions.
- UTR: The number of bases aligned to UTRs.
- Intronic: The number of bases aligned to intronic regions.
- Intergenic: The number of bases aligned to intergenic regions.

Coding, UTR, Intronic and Intergenic are subsets of Aligned.

- Median CV Coverage: Median coefficient of variation for the 1000 most highly expressed genes.
- Median 5' Bias: Of the 1000 most highly expressed genes.
- Median 3' Bias: Of the 1000 most highly expressed genes.
- Median 5' to 3' Bias: The ratio of the two above.
- Duplication Rate: The proportion of reads detected as duplicates. For sequencing
methods that sample from only one end of a gene, this is expected to be high.

@@ERCC_section

# ERCC Spike-ins
ERCC spike-in sequences have been added to the samples. These can be used in downstream
normalisation or used to gauge the success of technical aspects of the sequencing
not dependent on the sample material.

There are two spike-in mixes, with the same transcripts in different proportions.
This enables the estimation of fold-changes between the mixes, which can be
checked against the known true ratio. Each mix also has a variety of transcripts at different
concentrations, which provides an indication as to sensitivity.

Consult the [User Guide](http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_086340.pdf) for more details.

@@ERCC_mix_reads

## Detection {.tabset .tabset-pills}
These plots show how many reads map to each of the ERCC transcripts, in each mix.
There is a natural minimum to the observed values, which corresponds to 1 read
in the sample. However, transcripts with less than 1 expected read will still
be detected in some samples.

Each colour represents a different sample. 
The red line is a trend line calculated from the data. The green line is the ideal
perfect correspondence.
