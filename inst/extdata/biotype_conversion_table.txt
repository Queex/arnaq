polymorphic_pseudogene	pseudogene	Pseudogene owing to a SNP/DIP but in other individuals/haplotypes/strains the gene is translated.
processed_pseudogene	pseudogene	Pseudogene that lack introns and is thought to arise from reverse transcription of mRNA followed by reinsertion of DNA into the genome.
processed_transcript	other	Doesn't contain an ORF.
pseudogene	pseudogene	Have homology to proteins but generally suffer from a disrupted coding sequence and an active homologous gene can be found at another locus. Sometimes these entries have an intact coding sequence or an open but truncated ORF, in which case there is other evidence used (for example genomic polyA stretches at the 3' end) to classify them as a pseudogene. Can be further classified as one of the following.
